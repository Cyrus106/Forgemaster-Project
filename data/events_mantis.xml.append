You lie through your teeth, telling the Mantis how by plugging a power line into itself you can generate "infinite energy" and power all of these weapons. The Bishop cannot contain its excitement.</text>

				<text>"You show Hive and Queen, great kindness. Now Hive show you great kindness." The Mantis calls in numerous Hive ships and they begin loading supplies onto your ship. "We bring you another weapon for your super weapon ship!" The Bishop proclaims proudly. "Soon, whole Hive fleet will fly these." You hand over the ship's blueprint and they let you go in peace.</text>

			<text>The Mantis and Slug glance at each other for a solid minute, then look back at you. "Perhapsss I wasss too quick to judge." The Slug says, clearly calming down a bit. "You....not stupid ones. I sorry." the Mantis responds. "Now this new ship is truly stupid one. Look at stupid ship!". The Mantis continues, mocking you. Both the Mantis and the Slug make peace, while mocking you constantly until you cut comms.</text>
