REQUIRES FUSION TO FUNCTION!!!
A major expansion for Multiverse! It includes new NPCs, quests, weapons, sectors, bosses, and more. Drones and augments are coming soon! The primary new feature is: the weapon crafting system, which allows you to combine
numerous weapon combinations into stronger variants (or at the very least, side-grades).These weapons are intended to shine brightest when used on ships with less weapon slots and make use of the newest, most complex features hyperspace has to offer for a completely unique feel! New tooltips will appear on weapon components that can be used for crafting!

0.6 Features:
- removed most crew jank
- minor balance adjustments
- more modular hull bs
- drones?
- another quest?

Excluding all the features from previous versions, 0.5 introduces;
-14 new craftable weapons!
-A new line of weapons, found in a certain kind of sector.
-A new upgrade system called the 'Modular Hull', which you can buy from the Forgemaster at his event!
-A whopping 18 new ship layouts, each obtained by beating the Twisted Renegades with their un-twisted ship variants!
-Drastically changed weapon prices, now ranging from 30-140 scrap.
-A new button at the Forgemaster, allowing you to re-enter the Forgemasters menu multiple times at the same beacon!

0.4.0 Features:

-44 weapons (including the 0.3.4 weapons of course)
-5 new drones (2 exclusive to one line of ships)
-A few new augments
-A new NPC, Alastair the Forgemaster who will now be the facility used for crafting Forgemaster weapons. He will charge you for his services of course, so crafting is no longer free and crafting prices will be used to attempt to balance the risk / reward of each craft.
-The NPC also sells NINE weapons every time you visit him, and can only display weapons in his store that are used for crafting his recipes
-The NPC will be a hub for a vast majority of Forgemaster quests, of which I plan to implement quite a lot in the future.
-Several new quests
-1 new ending
-Plenty of foreshadowing
-3 new unique crew
and MUCH MORE!
