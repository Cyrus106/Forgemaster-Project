A major expansion for Multiverse! It includes new NPCs, quests, weapons, sectors, bosses, and more. Drones and augments are coming soon! The primary new feature is: the weapon crafting system, which allows you to combine
numerous weapon combinations into stronger variants (or at the very least, side-grades).These weapons are intended to shine brightest when used on ships with less weapon slots and make use of the newest, most complex features hyperspace has to offer for a completely unique feel! New tooltips will appear on weapon components that can be used for crafting!

(experimental build with optimized forgemaster spawning by Julk)
